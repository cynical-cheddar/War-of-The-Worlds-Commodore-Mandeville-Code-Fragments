# War of The Worlds Commodore Mandeville Code Fragments

  ![Propaganda banner](https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM3OTQwOTUuanBn/original/XDkamh.jpg)

A subset of the codebase used in my title "Commodore Mandeville: War of The Worlds - Revenge of The Martians".

Due to the project folder being in excess of 30GB, I cannot upload the whole base.

  

The game itself acts as a tech demo, with every ship and module being modelled as its own independent, intelligent system.

The nature of the game changed over time, from manually controlling a single ship, to a fully 3d RTS. Original control schemes are all still in place.

  

Software engineering practices have been followed.

  

The game itself still contains a large degree of placeholder assets.
